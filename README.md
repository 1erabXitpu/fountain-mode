## Plot Summary
     
The film begins with a series of news reports showing that meteors are crashing into the oceans near several major cities around the world. However, it is soon revealed that the meteors are actually spacecrafts carrying hostile extraterrestrial forces. In Los Angeles, Marine Staff Sergeant Michael Nantz (Eckhart) is preparing to retire after a failed mission in Iraq that resulted in the deaths of several men under his command. He is assigned to a new platoon led by Second Lieutenant William Martinez (Ramon Rodriguez), who is inexperienced and nervous about his first combat mission.
     
The platoon is flown by helicopter to Santa Monica Airport, where they join other military forces in setting up a forward operating base. They are given a mission to rescue a group of civilians who are trapped at a police station in West Los Angeles, which is within the alien-controlled territory. They have only three hours to complete the mission before the Air Force bombs the area. Along the way, they encounter fierce resistance from the aliens, who have advanced weaponry and armor. They also discover that the aliens are harvesting water from the Earth, which is vital for their survival.
     
The platoon manages to reach the police station and rescue the civilians, including veterinarian Michele (Moynahan), children Hector (Bryce Cass) and Kirsten (Joey King), and bus driver Joe (Peña). However, they find out that their extraction point has been overrun by the aliens, and that the Air Force bombing has been delayed due to a malfunctioning command satellite. They decide to make their way to another extraction point at the Santa Monica Pier, while fighting off more alien attacks. Along the way, they lose several members of their team, including Martinez, who sacrifices himself to destroy an alien command center.

At the pier, Nantz contacts an Air Force pilot named Elena Santos (Rodriguez), who is part of a group of survivors who have been fighting the aliens from the air. She agrees to help them escape by providing air support and guiding them to a safe landing zone. Nantz and his remaining men board a bus driven by Joe and head for the freeway, while Santos and her fellow pilots distract the aliens with missiles and flares. They manage to reach the landing zone, where they are picked up by helicopters and taken to a Marine base in Mojave Desert.
     
At the base, Nantz learns that similar alien attacks have occurred in other cities around the world, but that some of them have been successfully repelled by human forces. He also learns that his actions have inspired other Marines to fight back against the invaders. He is offered a chance to retire, but he declines and chooses to rejoin his platoon for another mission. The film ends with a montage of scenes showing the ongoing battle between humans and aliens in Los Angeles.
     
## Critical Reception
     
Battle Los Angeles received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 36% based on 211 reviews, with an average rating of 4.7/10. The website's critical consensus reads: "Overlong and overly burdened with war movie clichés, Battle: Los Angeles will entertain only the most ardent action junkies."[1] On Metacritic, it has a score of 37 out of 100 based on 35 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".[2]
     
Some critics praised the film for its realistic depiction of urban warfare and its intense action scenes. Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times gave it three out of four stars, writing: "Battle: Los Angeles is noisy, violent, ugly and stupid. Its manufacture is a reflection of appalling cynicism on the part of its makers, who don't even try to make it more than senseless chaos. Here's a science-fiction film that's an insult to the words 'science' and 'fiction,' and the hyphen in between them."[3] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave it two and a half out of four stars, calling it "a tense, terrifically shot action dazzler" that "hits hard and fast".[4]
     
However, many critics criticized the film for its lack of originality, its shaky camera work, and its shallow characters. A.O. Scott of The New York Times wrote: "Battle: Los Angeles is a noisy, violent, ugly and stupid movie about noisy, violent, ugly and stupid aliens trying to conquer Earth by blowing up Los Angeles. It is also a noisy, violent, ugly and stupid movie about noisy, violent, ugly and stupid humans trying to stop them by blowing up Los Angeles."[5] Richard Roeper of RichardRoeper.com gave it a D+, saying: "This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's a cliché-ridden, laughable mess."[6]
